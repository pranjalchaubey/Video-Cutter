# Video-Cutter
Full HD High Precision Video Cutter written in Python. 
</br></br> 
I could not find any 'precision' video cutter for free on the 
internet, so decided to pair with Mr Claude and write my own. 
</br></br>
You can provide highly precise timestamps, and cut the video in 
multiple parts. 
</br>
The Code was written to fetch and write data directly to the 
Google Drive. 
</br>
There is provision to display frames with timestamps, for 
hyper precise cutting. 
</br></br>
The codebase is a complete mess and was written mostly by 
Mr Claude. 
</br>
If you are not sure how to find your way around it,
just copy-paste the whole code to any GPT, it should </br>
be able to tell you what needs to be done. 
</br></br>
I am quite lazy, but if I find time and motivation, </br>
I would properly document the code and add some more flexibility to </br>
the ```cut_video()``` function.
